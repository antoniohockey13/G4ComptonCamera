## Author: Antonio Gómez Carrera

## Code structure

Two main folders ``Headers´´ and ``Source´´:
In headers all *.hh files.
In Source all *.cc files.

construction :
Includes the definition of the geometry

physics :
Includes the main physical processes simulated.

generator :
Generates the particle gun for the experiment. In this case it is an X-Ray source.
